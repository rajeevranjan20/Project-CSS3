        <h2>Sun</h2>
        <p>
            The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, and it's the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Here's some information about the Sun. <br>
            The Sun is a fascinating celestial object that continues to captivate scientists and astronomers with its complexity and importance in understanding the universe. <br>
            The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%) by mass. Other elements, such as oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron, make up the remaining percentage.

        <h2>Earth</h2>
        <p>
            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. 
            Earth's unique combination of atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere makes it uniquely suited for life as we know it.
            It's the only known planet where life exists, and its habitability has allowed for the development of complex ecosystems and civilizations.
            Earth's climate varies widely depending on factors such as latitude, elevation, proximity to oceans, and atmospheric circulation patterns. 
            It includes various climate zones, such as tropical, temperate, and polar regions, each with distinct weather patterns and ecosystems.
            Earth is a remarkable planet with a rich history, diverse environments, and a profound influence on the conditions necessary for life in the universe.

        <h2>Mars</h2>
        <p>
            Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun in the solar system. 
            Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (about 95.3%), with small amounts of nitrogen, argon, and oxygen. The atmosphere is much thinner than Earth's, with surface pressure less than 1% of Earth's atmospheric pressure. It provides little protection from solar radiation and does not support liquid water on the surface.
            Mars has a cold and dry climate, with average temperatures around -63°C (-81°F) and extremes ranging from about -125°C (-195°F) at the poles to 20°C (68°F) at the equator during the warmest part of the day. The planet experiences dust storms, which can cover large areas and last for weeks or even months.
            Evidence suggests that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, as indicated by features like ancient river valleys, lakebeds, and minerals that form in the presence of water. While some water ice exists at the poles and in underground reservoirs, most of the planet's water is believed to have escaped into space over time.

        <h2>Saturn</h2>
        <p>
            Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our solar system, known for its stunning rings. 
            Saturn's atmosphere, like Jupiter's, is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of other gases such as methane and ammonia. It exhibits colorful bands and zones similar to Jupiter but is less prominent.
            Saturn's majestic rings and diverse moon system make it one of the most captivating objects in our solar system, inspiring wonder and curiosity among scientists and enthusiasts alike.

        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
            Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is often referred to as a gas giant.
            One of the most iconic features of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. It is a high-pressure region in Jupiter's atmosphere, which creates a swirling pattern of clouds. The Great Red Spot is larger than Earth and is continuously monitored by astronomers.
            Jupiter has a vast system of moons, with at least 79 known moons as of the latest count. The four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), were discovered by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are among the most fascinating objects in the solar system. These moons are thought to have subsurface oceans and potential conditions suitable for life.
            Jupiter's immense size, complex atmosphere, and extensive moon system make it a captivating subject of study for astronomers and space enthusiasts alike.

        <h2>Mercury</h2>
        <p>
            Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system.
            Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and resembles the Moon's surface in many ways. It also has expansive plains, cliffs, and ridges. One of its most prominent features is the Caloris Basin, a large impact crater created by a collision early in the planet's history.
            Mercury has a very thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere, composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. This exosphere is so thin that it does not affect the temperature on the planet's surface significantly, and it cannot support human life as we know it.
            Mercury's proximity to the Sun and its unique characteristics make it a fascinating object of study for scientists seeking to understand the formation and evolution of rocky planets in the solar system.

        <h2>Neptune</h2>
        <p>
            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in our solar system.
            Neptune was first observed in 1846 by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. Its discovery was prompted by mathematical predictions based on observed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus, suggesting the presence of another planet beyond it.
            Neptune is often classified as an "ice giant" like Uranus. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its blue color. Like Uranus, Neptune has a high concentration of methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light, giving it its distinct blue hue.
            Neptune remains one of the most mysterious and least explored planets in the solar system, with much left to discover about its composition, structure, and atmosphere.

        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the solar system and is classified as an ice giant.
            Uranus was officially discovered in 1781 by the British astronomer Sir William Herschel. It was the first planet to be discovered with a telescope.
            The only spacecraft to have visited Uranus up close is NASA's Voyager 2 probe, which flew by the planet in 1986. Voyager 2 provided valuable data and images of Uranus and its moons during its flyby.
            Uranus still holds many mysteries, including the exact nature of its interior and the cause of its unusual magnetic field, which is tilted at a significant angle compared to its rotation axis.
